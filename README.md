Project Description: This project is done to experiment using the Convolutional Neural Network Model (CNN) to predict the colored photos of 4 different kinds of fruit, namely ‘Apple’, ‘Orange’, ‘Banana’, and ‘Mixed’. A training dataset with 240 samples, and a testing dataset of 60 samples were provided for the experiment.
